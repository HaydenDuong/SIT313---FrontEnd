<!-- After running npm run build, your project generates a build directory which contains the production-ready static files, including an index.html file. The index.html in the public directory is the template used during development and for building the production files. -->
 <!--
  Purpose of `npm run build`:
  
  The `npm run build` command is used to create an optimized, production-ready build of your React application.
  
  Key Points:
  
  1. **Optimization**: The build process optimizes the React application by minifying the JavaScript files, optimizing assets (like images and CSS), and generating static files. This results in faster load times and improved performance in production environments.
  
  2. **Static Files**: The output of the build process is a set of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that can be served by any static file server. These files are placed in the `build` directory.
  
  3. **Production Deployment**: The static files in the `build` directory are what you deploy to your production server. When users access your application, these files are served, providing the complete React application.
  
  4. **Update Deployment**: Whenever you make changes to your React application and want to deploy those changes, you need to run `npm run build` again to generate an updated set of static files. The new build should replace the old build on your server.
  
  Steps to follow after making updates to the React application:
  
  1. Make changes to your React application.
  2. Run `npm run build` to generate a new production build.
  3. Replace the old `build` folder on your server with the newly generated `build` folder.
  4. Restart your back-end server to ensure it serves the latest build.
  
  Example command to run the build process:
  
  ```bash
  npm run build -->
